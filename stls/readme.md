# Printing

  - Parts have not been oriented for printinting (yet), but they are designed to be printed with no supports.
  - I recommend printing in ASA/ABS but for something unclosed you should be able to print it PETG (mostly important for hotend and bed mount).
  - There will be printable brackets for the electronics mounting but the lasered one's are preferred for slimness.
  - Fan ducts are in the work
