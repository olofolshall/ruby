# Design
My initial design goal was to make it more visually appealing but more importantly to make it enclosed so it was possible to print more demanding/picky materials on it such as ABS, ASA, PC, etc.

# Features
- Laser Cut Stainless Steel Frame (ideally 400-series)
- Printed parts designed with FEA for optimal part strength (work in progress)
- Fully enclosed build chamber (work in progress)
- Backpack style electronics (with a focus on CE certification)
- 235mm^3 build area
- Sherpa Mini and Mosquito hotend adaptation
- Blind jointed frame
- Annex Engineering Carabiner with IGUS cable for easy cable management
- Annex Engineering micro switch magnetic probe
- Klipper firmware
- Neopixel Lighting 
- CFD optimized dual 5015 part cooling fan (work in progress)
- Manufacturing and Sourcing practicality and feasibility study in the works as well (hey canâ€™t leave out business and econ)

More features such as 3 point bed leveling are in the planning but not implemented as of yet. I am also planning to write a full set of assembly instructions and publish all firmware configurations and such on here at a later point. 

 
 # Important notes
This project is still a work in progress and everything is subject to change. I am mostly done ordering parts and have started assembling individual sections of the printer. For all sources of inspiration or parts/models I used which are not my own design please see the Sources file which will include links. If you see some of your design or are in doubt of any violated licenses please contact me and I will investigate ASAP.
