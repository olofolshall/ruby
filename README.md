# Design
My initial design goal was to make it more visually appealing but more importantly to make it enclosed so it was possible to print more demanding/picky materials on it such as ABS, ASA, PC, etc. 
In the process I stumbled across many ideas which I implemented either by changing the original or by drawing up my own.
The XY gantry design stems from Thingiverse user Gavitka who did an awesome job of providing improved funcionality and a little bit more of visual ease.
Another design goal was to reduce the total part count which I am still working on.

# Features
- Fully enclosed build chamber
- Backpack style electronics
- 235mm^3 build area
- Sherpa Minihotend adaptation
- Blind jointed frame
- Annex engineering micro switch magnetic probe
- Klipper firmware
- Neopixel Lighting 


More features such as 3 point bed leveling are in the planning but not implemented as of yet. I am also planning to write a full set of assembly instructions and publish all firmware configurations and such on here at a later point. 

 
 # Important notes
This project is still a work in progress and everything is subject to change. I am mostly done ordering parts and have started assembling individual sections of the printer. For all sources of inspiration or parts/models I used which are not my own design please see the Sources file which will include links. If you see some of your design or are in doubt of any violated licenses please contact me and I will investigate ASAP.
